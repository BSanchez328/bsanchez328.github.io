        <h1><font face="helvetica">About Me!</font></h1>
        <p><img src="images/deadmeme.jpg" height="500" align="left" hspace="10"><font color="white" face="helvetica">I'm a high school senior nearly finished with my year (three more weeks to go woo!). My better subjects are in math and science.
        Aside from my scholared character, I enjoy video games of all kinds, but I'm more experienced with platformers from Nintendo consoles and PC MOBAS. I like Marvel, Disney, Pixar, and Netflix Originals;
        I also like Animes (yes call me a weeb for all I care); but under overall themes for stories I enjoy Action, Comedy, Drama (but I'm very picky about it when it comes to quality or impact by it), 
        Isekai: Different World (again, quality/impact), School (quality/impact), Adventure, but most importantly - a great story, an interesting them, or both. I'm tired a lot of the time, even if I carry 
        enough energy like the average person my face will be hardly expressive or smiling when conversations are dull, but that's also because I keep myself reserved. I'm largely, if not fairly, philosophical, 
        verbose, and mentally mature when it comes to certain dilemmas for others. I won't hesitate to be rude, but I'm awfully careful about how I present my character regardless of presence or hypocrisy. I 
        usually see any new situation to call for a new perspective of things, or relate it to something noteworthy of the past. The rest about me is up to others to find out and/or understand.</font></p>
